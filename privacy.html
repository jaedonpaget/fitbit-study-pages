  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> [2026-01-20]</p>

  <h2>1. Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This App accesses Fitbit heart-rate data via the Fitbit Web API after you authorize access
    through Fitbit’s consent screen. The App is intended for the App owner’s personal/academic use.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fitbit heart-rate intraday data (timestamped heart-rate values).</li>
    <li>OAuth tokens provided by Fitbit (access token and refresh token) to access the API.</li>
    <li>Basic technical logs needed to run the script (e.g., timestamps of requests/errors).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How we use data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To download heart-rate data from Fitbit and save it to local files (e.g., CSV/JSON) on your computer.</li>
    <li>To maintain access to the Fitbit API by refreshing OAuth tokens when required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Where data is stored</h2>
  <p>
    Data is stored locally on the App owner’s computer. The App does not intentionally upload your
    Fitbit data to any external server.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not sell Fitbit data and does not share Fitbit data with third parties, except that
    Fitbit processes API requests as part of providing the Fitbit platform.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Data is kept only as long as needed for the personal/academic project and can be deleted at any time
    by removing the locally saved files.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>
    Reasonable measures are used to protect locally stored files (for example, keeping the computer account
    private and not publishing token files). However, no method of storage is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can revoke the App’s access at any time from your Fitbit account settings.</li>
    <li>You can delete the locally stored files at any time.</li>
  </ul>
